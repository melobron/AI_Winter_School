		- Inductive transfer learning (Multi-task learning): same domains but **different source/target Tasks**
		- Transductive transfer learning (Domain Adaptation): samd tasks but **different source/target Domains**
		- Unsupervised transfer learning: different Tasks/Domains
		- Domain Confusion
		- Zero-shot / One-shot / Few-shot learning  

	2. Methodologies

		- Parameter transfer
		- Instance transfer: use target domain data + some portion of source domain data
		- Feature representation transfer
		- Relational knowledge transfer
